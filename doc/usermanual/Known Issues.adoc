There are some known issues that may not be tackled in short-term. They properly would be addressed in a later time, and might be improved bit by bit before fully addressed.

- In a JVM with default JVM arguments, the depth of recursion calls only support up to about 140. Beyond that, "StackOverflowError" would be thrown.
- Deep recursion calls use lots of memory and run slower
